# SnowMonkey

SnowMonkey adds an abstraction over Apple components that requires a lot of boilerplate delegation code like UITableView, UICollectionView or UIPickerView

It handles the delegation for you and provide an easiest way to manages your components using simple methods like addRow, deleteRow, etc
